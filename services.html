        <h3> Surendered Cats </h3>
        <p> We open our doors to cats in need of a second chance. We understand that circumstances change, and sometimes families are no longer able to care for their beloved pets. That's why we offer a compassionate surrender program, providing a safe haven for cats in need of a new home. Whether due to financial hardship, life changes, or other reasons, we welcome surrendered cats into our shelter with warmth and understanding. Our experienced staff ensures that each cat receives the care and attention they deserve while they await their forever homes. Through our surrender program, we strive to alleviate the burden on both cats and their owners, offering a supportive, judgement-free environment where cats can thrive until they find a second home.  </p>
